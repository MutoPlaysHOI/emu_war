 loser_of_the_emu_war_desc:0 "Australia's defeat in the Great Emu War of 1932 has set their people revolting due to the shame this defeat has given them; a war won by animals. If the Australian government doesn't do anything to calm the people down, the rebellions might turn into a civil war."
 emu_rebellion:0 "Emu Rebellion"
 emu_rebellion_desc:0 "Due to our humiliating defeat in the Emu War, it would seem as if people who support the Emus are rebelling, hoping that the whole nation of Australia becomes the Emus' ally. If we're not careful enough, this rebellion might turn into a civil war."

 recruit:0 "Recruiting Propaganda"

 delusional_commanders:0 "Delusional Commanders"
 delusional_commanders_desc:0 "Our commanders are, for some reason, delusional, in denial every time we criticise them or we say they did something wrong. It is unknown why they are this way, but one thing for sure is that we need to reorganize our army."

It was also signed to prevent us Emus from being a \"threat in the future\" by making sure we don't declare war on Australia or other countries until the treaty expires in 1939. If we want to assert our dominance over the humans, we must somehow alter or abolish the treaty. We could also renounce the treaty altogether however we may receive some backlash and action may be taken against us if we do such a thing."
 final_measures:0 "Final Measures"
 final_measures_desc:0 "It would seem like we have no choice but to strike back at the humans. They have threatened us many times and we have threatened them many times, but the humans are the aggressors, and we are the defenders, so we have every right to retaliate in self defence. Desperate times call for desperate measures, but the humans have gone too far, and final measures are needed to combat them."

 free_trade_emu:0 "Free Trade"
 free_trade_emu_desc:0 "Despite being the clear winner of the Great Emu War back in 1932, the Treaty of Uluru has forced the Emus to open up their trade ports and allow free trade across all the nations of the world. This has caused some economic downturns for the Emus as they struggle to survive due to the treaty. If the Emus want to live to see another decade, they must take action to limit the effects of the treaty or renounce it altogether, whether the stakes are high or not."
 broken_economy:0 "Broken Economy"
 broken_economy_desc:0 "The forced free trade in the Treaty of Uluru has severely damaged the Emu economy, and it's on the verge of economic collapse. The Emu industry is barely functioning, and many are starting to close down due to bankruptcy.
