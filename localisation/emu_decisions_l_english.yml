 EMU_treaty_of_uluru:0 "Treaty of Uluru"
 EMU_treaty_of_uluru_desc:0 "Ever since the end of the Emu War in 1932, our country has been suffering because of the Treaty of Uluru. Our military is crippled, and our ability to recover is slowly diminishing. We as the victors of the war should have the right to take action against something uncalled for. It's time to rise up against the humans and stand up for ourselves by taking necessary action so that we won't be picked on by the humans."
 treaty_of_uluru_renounced:0 " Treaty of Uluru renounced"
 renounce_the_treaty:0 "Renounce the Treaty"
 renounce_the_treaty_desc:0 "We as a sovereign nation should have the right to be able to build and fund a military, and the Treaty of Uluru is violating that right. We need to make sure we gain our rights back, and although renouncing the Treaty of Uluru may cause some backlash, it is the only thing we can do to ensure we get our rights of building a military back, because we have no other choice."
 negotiate_peace_talks:0 "Negotiate Peace Talks"
 negotiate_peace_talks_desc:0 "While we may not be fond of the humans, we still have to sort things out diplomatically, to ensure we don't cause any more trouble than we already have. We could arrange peace talks with the British and Australians about the Treaty of Uluru, and convince them to disband the treaty. After all, it has been many years since that treaty was signed, and at this point in time, treaties shouldn't be a thing anymore, considering what's been going on outside this peaceful continent."
 institute_press_censorship_animalist_state:0 "Institute Press Censorship"
 institute_press_censorship_animalist_state_desc:0 "These are dangerous times and we can't allow dissenting voices to tear our country apart. Restricting the freedom of the press is necessary to ensure that the truth is heard loud and clear."
